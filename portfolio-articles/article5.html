      <h4>Hacking Celiac Disease</h4>
      <h3>ProFacts</h3>

      <p>ProFacts is a web app that acts like Yelp for people with food allergies, specifically in its first iteration, celiac disease. </p>
      <p>I started working on ProFacts during a hackathon at UC Davis where I met Alexander Godbout and Vidush Vishwanath, who were both undergraduate biomedical engineering students at the time. Alex had an idea to create a database of wheat proteins and genetically match them with peopleâ€™s allergy tolerances to create a way to predict where people could eat out or go grocery shopping safely when they had celiac disease.</p>
      <p>We created a highly accessible web app that could be used on both mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. We first discussed what functions we wanted to include in the MVP as we had a short amount of time to complete our project, within the hackathon. Then split up the work into visual design and layout, frontend code, and backend code. I was surprised and pleased to discover the judges of the hackathon cared just as much about how the app would look, feel, and work, as they did about the functionality of our backend database. </p>
      <p>At that time, I did not have any knowledge of front end web development and had a lot less design experience and so, every minute of the project was self-teaching and figuring out how to scrap our skills together in an effective way. </p>
