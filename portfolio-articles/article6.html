      <h4>Design for Social Impact</h4>
      <h3>Liberty and Justice For All</h3>

      <p>A friend approached me with an idea for a sweatshirt design to fight against Islamophobia. My friend Gurjat is Sikh, but also has faced the consequences of Islamophobia in his life. He had a concept for a sweatshirt in which the Statue of Liberty is wearing a headscarf, along with the phrase “Liberty and Justice for All.”</p>
      <p>I decided to help him on the project because I agree with the ideals of religious liberties and wanted to support marginalized communities. Additionally, since I’m not an illustrator, we had to find someone who could draw his vision so that I could then digitize it and have it printed on merchandise.</p>
      <p>We started by collecting visual references on a Pinterest board, so we are all on the same page when it came to the style we wanted to pursue for the illustration. I first reached out to my friend Roxanne, who is a fantastic illustrator and explained the idea and she was very excited to help out. We then created a Pinterest board about the style, and based on our mutual goals, Roxanne illustrated in traditional materials, in pencil and ink, and shaded a version of the Statue of Liberty that I then took into Illustrator and  turned into a vector graphic. </p>
      <p>We had to communicate entirely online because all three of us were in separate locations, at one point, Roxanne was in Alaska and mailed me the illustrations from there, because of the distance between us all, the project is going slower than what we had hoped, but it is still making progress. It hopefully will be available for purchase soon.</p>
      <p>I learned from working with an artist who does traditional materials, I had to be incredibly specific about how they go about their work in order to produce quality digital graphics at the end. We ran into an issue where the labeling of the drawing was done in such a way that I had to go back and clean up all the linework digitally, which contributed to the delay of the project. For future projects, I learned that clear communication is key in order to avoid delays in team collaboration.</p>
