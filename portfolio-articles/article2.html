      <h4>Human Centered Design</h4>
      <h3>Where's My Bike?</h3>

      <p>Where’s My Bike is a project intended to improve bike parking at UC Davis. The UC Davis Human-Centered Design class challenged everyone to find a way to improve the currently terrible conditions of bike parking on campus. The challenge was that students had to upgrade the bike parking, but without simply replacing all existing parking. We accomplished this by interviewing people and finding their real needs, in order to find innovative solutions.</p>
      <p>My final design is a system of color coding existing bike racks so that bike riders can easily find their rides. Color coding is effective because it is unusual, fun, and aids in memory retrieval by breaking down a large group of parking racks into individual sections. </p>
      <p>I came up with that solution by first interviewing people to discover what the hidden problems with bike parking are. Then I brainstormed solutions for the specific problem of forgetting one’s bike while in a rush to travel to the next destination.</p>
      <p>I definitely faced challenges, but the project taught me how to work quickly, how to not be a perfectionist, and how to rely on user feedback for real insights. This was all while learning the human-centered design process in 5 weeks, taking two other classes, and actively working on a real project using the human-centered design process.</p>
