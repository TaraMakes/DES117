      <h4>Collaborative Web App</h4>
      <h3>Balanced Weather</h3>

      <p>Balanced Weather is a web app where I got to play the role of visual designer and work with a student from the Computer Science Department who would apply my design to a real web app connected to Yahooâ€™s weather API.</p>
      <p>My design decisions were informed by my own habits. I check the weather late at night before going to bed, and found that the color palettes on most weather sites are extremely harsh on the eyes at 2 am in the morning. I decided to go with an all orange scheme, because orange does not interrupt the production of norepinephrine, which is a hormone that affects wake-and-sleep schedules. This would lead to less interrupted sleep and an improved quality of life.</p>
      <p>Overall, the visual design was an exercise in play, and clear and legible typography. I used Sketch for experimenting with typography. I also worked within the constraints of web design while using icons from the Noun Project.</p>
      <p>The hardest part about the project was communicating my design intentions to beginning developers. Many of the students were unfamiliar with design terms and I had to explain in great detail my intentions behind the site. However, I learned that collaboration can be incredibly fun.</p>
