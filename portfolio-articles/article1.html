      <h4>Responsive Site</h4>
      <h3>Design Career Fair</h3>

      <p>The Design Career Fair is a student-run career fair at UC Davis intended to help our fellow students connect with excellent job opportunities and promote better connections between design based companies and UC Davis.</p>
      <p>As the Web Team, we created the public face of the Design Career Fair on the Internet. The main challenge we faced was to create a site that would be useful for both students attending the fair and the companies attending the fair.</p>
      <p>As a team on the Design Careers Fair, we were given the branding and color scheme to work within. The Web Team interviewed potential employers and students to determine their needs, which helped inform our site mockups. Finally, we coded the site and hosted it through Github.</p>
      <p>The difficulties were that most of the team had little prior coding experience, so we learned quickly by doing. Teammates experienced in web development were available to answer questions as we taught ourselves using online resources.</p>
      <p>Though I had little prior experience, I learned how to hand code a website, and I learned how to work with a team with a variety of skills and strengths.</p>
