      <h4>Lighting Design</h4>
      <h3>Amber LED Cube Light</h3>

      <p>The Amber Cube Light is a small battery powered LED light that can be carried around the house to light your way at night.</p>
      <p>The Lighting Design class challenges students to design a light for nighttime use, but leaves the specific problems that it will be solving up to us. I decided to create this light after I realized how difficult it can be to navigate in a dark bedroom or house when you are trying to not wake up your roommate.</p>
      <p>I first started with notebook sketches to come up with various aesthetically pleasing shapes that will work well in terms of directing the light coming out of the light source. I then build multiple prototypes out of matboard, foamcore, tracing paper, basic battery switch LED lights, circuits, and lots of glue. Iâ€™m currently on the 3D model to try printing out. From that model I will be able to apply for a patent and look into the manufacturing process.</p>
      <p>Creating the preliminary models was incredibly difficult to create a floating effect between the three supporting panels of the light took significant trial and error with the tracing paper, and it is yet to be seen how effectively the design will transfer into more permanent materials. I learned that even rudimentary prototypes can function beautifully in real world settings, and I also learned that I really enjoy working with electronics and with light.</p>
