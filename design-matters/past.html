        <h2>The history of letterpress printing:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>While pressing an inked object to a secondary surface has existed as long as humans- imagine, for instance, handprints found in caves, the first letterpress machine as we know it was built in the fifteenth century by Johannes Gutenberg. His genius was to create a variation on the pre-existing technology of woodblock printing, but with re-arrangeable parts, as opposed to an artist carving a new wooden block for every print. While the press originally used carved wood to create the first stamp-like “type” - the individual letters that could be arranged and rearranged to create new pages - her later switched to metal type to improve legibility. Gutenberg’s press working by cranking handle attached to a screw further attached to the body of the press. The gradual cranking would compress the inked type against the page to be printed. Gutenberg’s first publication was a 1,282-page long Bilbe, which took nearly 3 years for his workshop of 20 people to complete. However, unlike many hand-written manuscripts of the era, we still have an excellent idea of what this first printed book looked like, as 48 copies still exist.</p>
	      <p>Over time the process of printing with a letterpress became quicker and more widespread. Printed works are credited as the driving force behind a great deal of political, religious, and social change in post-Gutenberg Europe. In 1473 the first book in English was printed by William Caxton, and as typographical experimentation continued, another William, Caslon, became famed for the clear and legible type of his prints in the 1700’s. In fact, the typefaces of William Caslon and John Baskerville are still referenced and re-created in digital formats today! Letterpress printing dominated the printing world for centuries, until in the 1950’s offset printing, a type of lithography, became more commercially popular. However this shift was not to last!</p>
