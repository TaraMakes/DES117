        <h2>What could the future of letterpress printing hold?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>While much letterpress use currently focuses on reviving past technologies and trends, new styles and uses continue to develop. Printing with metallic foils, or using a die-press to cut paper are already ways letterpress printing has changed. Given current methods of printing, it is not difficult to imagine new advances in inks and multimedia use emerging in the next 5 years. What other technological combinations may be in store further in the future? Letterpress merged with 3D printing? Letterpress tattooing? Letterpress onto wood, ceramic, plastic and metal?</p>
        <p>In fact, 3D-printing of movable type has already begun, and it is not unreasonable to imagine that laser-cutting wooden type is feasible, too. With such a beloved industry, people will certainly try anything. And given many old presses are still in use today, technologies will have to emerge to replace and maintain their functional parts and keep the industry going for another half-century. Cheers to letterpress!</p>
