        <h2>Contemporary letterpress printing:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Letterpress use has again become popular due to a combination of factors. While originally the “kiss”, “bite”, or “deboss” produced by a letterpress punching into paper was frowned upon greatly, in recent decades it has become quite desired. The ability of a letterpress print to create such a texturally interesting surface is often used in wedding invitations and greeting cards. Some credit the wedding industry as a main driver in the rebirth of interest in letterpress printing, as people seek out “authentic” and “crafted” papergoods. Additionally the 1980’s delivered a new flexibility to letterpress printing, with the development of photopolymer plates. Images can now be transferred directly from computer to printing plate, though plenty of printers and customers still use traditional typesetting techniques as well.</p>
        <p>Overall the letterpress industry seems to be thriving, artisanal print shops such as  Mama’s Sauce, of Florida, serve a national audience, while paper companies like Crane & Co. and French Paper produce papers that take impressions from letterpress well, and encourage the deboss trend. It is once again possible to take classes in letterpress printing and find shows of letterpress printed works.</p>
