          <h3>Reflection on creating "Our Roasters" page.</h3>
          <h4>October 9th 2016</h4>
          <p>Creating the “Our Roasters” page was quite simple. Given that we could entirely copy the index page we created in class, I did so, then swapped out images and text as needed. I did forget, however, to add the images/ before coffeebeans.jpg and so my image file didn’t load the first time around. I figured out what I’d done pretty quickly though. During the assignment there wasn’t anything I didn’t understand. I accidentally gave the file the wrong name though, and had to go back and change it and links to it to roasters.html instead of the one I’d made up. Next time, I think I’ll read the directions fully before starting, haha.</p>

          <h3>Awwwards Critique</h3>
          <h4>October 4th 2016</h4>
          <p>Site: https://flex.osram.info/en</p>
          <p>Critique: The Flex Osram website has a single function, to sell Osram LED “flex lights”. While the product is innovative, the website is not. It relies on a very stoic rectangular format for all of its content, displaying images and words in a card-like manner. However, and despite the lack of impression the design made on me, the website does its job well.</p>
          <p>The hierarchy of the site is fairly easy to understand, with a large logo, top navigation, and language selection followed by cards of content below. I quite like the images the site uses as they both highlight the possibilities of the product while maintaining an abstract architectural elegance. However, their interesting compositions are limited by the page’s regimented layout. I would love to see the images larger and not boxed in by a very literal card layout. Because it attempts to be dramatic, the copy is a tad mystifying unless you have or are currently taking a class on lighting design (I’m in luck!). This negatively impacts the usability, as one has no idea what each page will actually contain, but perhaps that’s the point. Curiosity drives the viewer through the site. Finally, the use of color is very subtle, perhaps to maintain focus on the images. While I like a minimal color palette, here I think it contrasts too strongly with the vibrant images. I’d like to use more color to accompany more exploded versions of the photos. However, I think someone who is a construction manager or an architect might find the site’s building-block-like layout comforting. In the end, it’s all up to the viewer, isn’t it?</p>
