        <h2>What is letterpress printing?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Letterpress printing has been around for ages. In the most basic of terms, it works by pressing carved type onto the surface to be printed. By craving the type in an inverse of the intended print shape it functions as giant stamp mounted within a larger compression machine, leaving behind an image facing the correct way. The type can be made of many materials, including wood, but metal is most common.</p>
